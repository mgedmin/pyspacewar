Planned features:

- online help
- recording/playback
- multiplayer mode
- customizable key bindings
- instead of VERSION.txt use version.py that uses $Revision$

Planned refactorings and cleanups:

- unit tests for ai.py
- refactor ai.py
- move Vector into a new module vector.py
- adjust other constants so that I could set Game.DELTA_TIME == 1.0
- get rid of Game.DELTA_TIME and the dt argument to World.update
