Planned refactorings and cleanups:

- unit tests for ai.py
- refactor ai.py
- move Vector into a new module vector.py
- adjust other constants so that I could set Game.DELTA.TIME == 1.0
- get rid of Game.DELTA_TIME and the dt argument to World.update

Features still missing:

- determine largest screen mode
- keep free space around planets (margin arg for collision detection)
- missile recoil (on launch and collisions)

Features to be discarded

- HUD debug info (draw time, update time)
- computed missile launch

Planned features that were not present in the old version

- recording/playback
- multiplayer mode
- customizable key bindings
- online help
