Planned refactorings and cleanups:

- unit tests for ai.py
- refactor ai.py
- move Vector into a new module vector.py
- adjust other constants so that I could set Game.DELTA_TIME == 1.0
- get rid of Game.DELTA_TIME and the dt argument to World.update

Features still missing:

- HUD debug info (draw time, update time)

Planned features that were not present in the old version

- online help
- recording/playback
- multiplayer mode
- customizable key bindings
