January 7, 2006: Happy New Year!

  - Add sound effects.
  - Show an animation (expanding bubble) when ships respawn.
  - Allow up to two keys to be bound to the same action.
  - Use 800x600 by default; if your computer is fast enough, you can change to
    a better video mode; if not, give a better first impression by avoiding
    sluggishness.
  - Change the options menu: show the current state (e.g. "missile orbits: on")
    instead of the action that would change it ("hide missile orbits").  Add
    an option to toggle sound propagation in vacuum (or, in practical terms,
    whether you hear a sound when a missile hits the computer-controlled ship
    or when it explodes).

December 25, 2006: Released version 0.9.3: the Christmas release.

  - Keyboard controls can now be customized.
  - Keyboard controls and video mode options are stored in a config file.
  - Added the -w command line option, in case you desire to override the config
    file.

February 20, 2006: Released version 0.9.2 (also known as the "a month of
procrastination" release).

  - Fixed the -f and -d command line options.
  - Missiles are now larger and brighter than their orbit trail dots.
  - Alt+Enter now also toggles fullscreen mode.
  - Make it work in 15 and 16 bit per pixel modes (no aaline).
  - Possibly fix the MacOS X "invisible fix" problem I saw (use 2 x aaline
    instead of aalines).
  - Added a help screen.
  - Added an Options menu.
  - Added a New Game menu (the main menu was becoming too cluttered).
  - Added a pyspacewar.pyw script for the convenience of Windows users.

January 14, 2006: Released version 0.9.1 with some bug fixes and small
features:

  - Use pygame.font.SysFont to locate Verdana.ttf on your system.
  - Fix "surfaces must not be locked during blit" bug.
  - Fix some cosmetic unit test failures.
  - Added a background image.
  - Made debug timings HUDs less intrusive.
  - Added an ability to specify the desired video mode on the command line.
  - The thrusters are now drawn more accurately.

January 8, 2006: After a week of intensive work, I released version 0.9.0.
User-visible changes:

  - Added an in-game menu.
  - You can drag the viewport around with the mouse (use the right button).
  - Automatic zoom in.
  - Radars show planet sizes, not just positions.
  - Dead ships fade away.
  - Information panels have translucent backgrounds.
  - Added an icon.

Internal code changes.

  - Split the code into several modules in a package.
  - Refactored the code extensively, it is now much more flexible.
  - Added unit tests.
  - Added a distutils setup script.


January 1, 2006: After a very nice New Year's party, I started working on
PySpaceWar again.  I want to refactor the code into separate logic and graphics
parts, and add unit tests.  I want to add a proper in-game menu (start new
game, options, exit, etc.).  In longer term I want to implement a networked
multiplayer mode, and a battle recorder with playback.


November 11, 2005: A minor tweak with zoom level.  It is difficult to implement
things I want with the current code base.  Thinking about a rewrite.


July 1-2, 2005: Minor tweaks, unsuccessful optimisations.


June 29, 2005: Demoed the game during EuroPython 2005 lightning talks session.
Was asked if the game could be played over the network.  Said that no, but
that I accept patches.  Nobody sent me a patch, though.


June 27-29, 2005: EuroPython 2005.  Having much fun with the game.  Sometimes
I'm hacking during the talks.


June 25, 2005: The weekend before EuroPython 2005.  A couple of days ago
my coworker Ignas told me about a game called Gravity Wars.  I found a free
Pascal version on-line and spent a couple of evenings playing it.  I am now
suddenly overcome by a hacking mood.  I will try to write a gravity based
game (Spacewar or Gravity Wars or both) with PyGame.
